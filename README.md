# Optimizing-Car-Price-Predictions-through-Machine-Learning-Regression-and-SVM-Model-Tuning

Currency Conversion: Prices of cars are converted from Rupee to Dollars with the exchange rate of USD 1 = Rupee 75.

Data Cleaning: Dollar symbols and Rupee symbols are removed from the price column.

State Column Creation: The address column is used to create a new column for the state.

Preprocessing & Data Cleaning: Statistical approaches are used for preprocessing and data cleaning to prepare the data for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis: The data is analyzed using exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the car market.

Statistical Analysis: Statistical analysis is performed to draw conclusions from the data.

Model Building: Various machine learning regression models are built with a test size of 30% and a random state parameter of 1.

Model Evaluation: The models are evaluated using evaluation matrix.

SVM Model for Regression: The best performing model is selected as the SVM model for regression.

SVM Model Evaluation: The SVM model is evaluated to determine its performance.

Hyper-Parameter Tuning: The SVM model is optimized through hyper-parameter tuning.

User-Friendly Price Prediction Function: A user-friendly price prediction function is created with an accuracy of 86% based on user input.

Conclusion: The car prediction model project is a comprehensive study of the car market, involving preprocessing and cleaning of the data, analysis, model building, and optimization. The final result of the project is a user-friendly price prediction function with an accuracy of 86%
